display_menu(): This function prints out the menu for the to-do list application. It doesn’t take any arguments and doesn’t return anything. It just prints the menu options to the console.
main(): This is the main function that runs the to-do list application. It doesn’t take any arguments.
tasks = []: This line initializes an empty list called tasks. Each task is a dictionary with two keys: “title” and “status”.
while True:: This is an infinite loop that keeps the application running until the user chooses to quit (option 5).
try...except...else...finally: This is a try/except block that handles errors. If an error occurs in the try block, the program execution moves to the except block. If no error occurs, the else block is executed. The finally block is always executed at the end, regardless of whether an error occurred.
Inside the try block, the program displays the menu, takes the user’s choice as input, and performs different actions based on the user’s choice.
if __name__ == "__main__":: This line checks if the script is being run directly (not being imported). If it is, it calls the main() function to start the application.
        
        
        Here’s what happens for each menu option:

Option 1 “Add a task”: The user is prompted to enter a task title. A new task dictionary is created with the title provided by the user and a status of “Incomplete”. This task is then added to the tasks list.
Option 2 “View tasks”: If the tasks list is empty, a message is printed to inform the user. If there are tasks, each task’s number, title, and status are printed.
Option 3 “Mark a task as complete”: If the tasks list is empty, a message is printed to inform the user. If there are tasks, the user is asked to enter the number of the task they want to mark as complete. The status of that task is then changed to “Complete”.
Option 4 “Delete a task”: If the tasks list is empty, a message is printed to inform the user. If there are tasks, the user is asked to enter the number of the task they want to delete. That task is then removed from the tasks list.
Option 5 “Quit”: The infinite loop is broken and the application ends.
Other inputs: If the user enters anything other than 1-5, an error message is printed and the menu is displayed again.
The except blocks handle specific errors that might occur, such as entering a non-numeric task number (ValueError), entering a task number that doesn’t exist (IndexError), or any other unexpected error (Exception). The else block is executed if no errors occur, and the finally block is always executed
